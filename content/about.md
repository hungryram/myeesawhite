I am a licensed real estate agent specializing in residential home sales and purchases in the Kansas City market. I am knowledgeable and persistent, continuously working on clients behalf and leaving no stone unturned to ensure my clients’ needs are met. Selling or buying a home is one of the most important financial decisions most clients have to make. That is why I am committed to establishing a true relationship with them, to understand their unique goals and work with them towards achieving those goals.

I genuinely cares about making a difference; creating a memorable experience and surpassing expectations. From the color of paint to use to enhance the look and presentation of the property to the close of the transaction, she’s there throughout the journey.

I set my services on a foundation of savvy negotiation skills and the latest marketing tools to get the best deals.

In my free time, I love to spend my time with my family or relishing the beauty of the outdoors.
